## 1.0.0 - 2014-01-23
Initial release of this fork (based off of v2.3 of original)
### Fixed
- When converting Latitude and Longitude between WGS84 and OSGB36 or vice-versa, a wrong constant for the y translation has been corrected (was off by 1 metre)
### Changed
- Eastings and northings are rounded to 1m, and lat/long to 5dp (approx 1m) to avoid any misconceptions that precision is the same thing as accuracy.
- When calculating surface distances, a more accurate mean radius is now used rather than that derived from historical definitions of a nautical mile
